Password strength Checker is a minor project and it works this way,
Length check: The base condition is this, this makes sure that the password is at least 8 characters long.
Lowercase letter check: At least one lowercase letter must be present.
Uppercase letter check: At least one uppercase letter must be present.
Digit check: At least one numeric digit should be there.
Special character check: Password should contain at least one special character, such as !@#$%^&*.
If all these conditions are met, the password is considered strong. Otherwise, it gives you feedback on what the password is missing.
